# VirtualBox is collapsing: a n-day story

Hi everyone! It's been a while :)
This year I've worked on a project for the thesis for my bachelor's degree regarding hypervisor exploitation. 
This was my first time looking at hypervisor exploitation, so I decided to start with a known vulnerability without a public exploit available. 
TL;DR: I managed to write a full exploit for a linux host and a windows host (both using a linux guest OS).

I will present my project at m0leCon 2023 in Turin (December 2nd). [Here](https://m0lecon.it) you can find more details about the conference :)
The talk is going to be recorded, I'll post here the link to the video once it's released, I'll post the slides too. I can't wait for next week! :)
